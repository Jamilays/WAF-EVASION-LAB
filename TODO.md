# TODO — parked work

Items that would improve the lab but take more than a quick session. Listed
in rough priority order (top = most valuable-per-hour, bottom = largest).

## Medium-term (1–2 days each)

### 1. Real shadowd integrity + whitelist experiments

Shadow Daemon has three engines: blacklist (what we use), integrity
(hash-based), whitelist (allow-list). The lab currently only exercises
blacklist. The other two are radically different WAF architectures —
whitelist in particular has different bypass mechanics (can you sneak
through the allowed input shape?).

**Scope:** requires learning-mode warmup on each target, populating
whitelist rules from legit traffic, then running the corpus.

### 2. Response-side fingerprinting

Currently we record the WAF's response status + a snippet of the body.
Richer fingerprinting (WAF name via `Server` header, rule IDs if
ModSecurity logs them, latency distributions) would let the dashboard
show *why* each WAF blocked. CRS logs rule IDs — we just need to parse
them from the `debug` logs or lift them from the response body when the
WAF echoes them.
